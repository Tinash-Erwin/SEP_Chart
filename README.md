# SEP_Chart
Specific Excess Power Chart (MATLAB)
1. Edit the excel inputs file
2. Run the partial SEP Chart file in Matlab
3. Output is a flight envelope with turn radius plotted against Mach number for different load factor and a limit lift coefficient
4. Gives the turn performance, load factor and turn rate for different mach  numbers
5. Ommited SEP lines, (bugs) 
6. Future version will have SEP lines

Meant for Aerospace students , requires MATLAB license(Student version at least, check with your school)
Feel free to edit and make improvements
